Absolutely! Here's a README for the URL shortening service:

# URL Shortening Service

This service provides a simple way to shorten URLs for easier sharing. The shortened URLs are generated based on the MD5 hash of the original URL. The entire service is in-memory, meaning shortened URLs will be lost on server restart.

## Project Structure

```
/url-shortener
|-- /data
|   |-- store.go             # Data structures & methods for in-memory URL store
|-- /handlers
|   |-- handlers.go          # HTTP handlers for shortening and redirecting URLs
|-- main.go                  # Entry point of the application, sets up routes & server
```

## Setup & Running

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Go installed (Go 1.11 or higher is recommended for module support).
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   cd url-shortener
   ```

3. **Start the Service**:
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

   This will start the server on port `8080`.

## Usage

**Shorten a URL**:
- Make a POST request to `/shorten` with a JSON payload containing the key `url` set to the URL you want to shorten. 
  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://www.example.com"
  }
  ```

  The server will respond with a shortened URL.

**Access a Shortened URL**:
- To access the original URL, simply use the shortened URL provided. The server will redirect you to the original URL.

## Notes

- This is a basic in-memory URL shortener suitable for demonstration purposes. 
- For production settings, consider implementing additional features like:
  - Using a persistent datastore.
  - Handling edge cases.
  - Implementing rate limiting.
  - Adding analytics for tracking URL usage.
